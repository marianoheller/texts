In the last years the world of work has seen a dramatic change. The interaction with clients, vendors or fellow employees from other countries is now much more common and can be done without ever leaving the office. Evidently, this has led to an increase in interactions across the globe which in turn also brought to the surface the vast contrast in styles and expectations between cultures.

For example, one study examined nearly 7500 questionnaire responses from managers and executives across 12 countries targetting 39 key personality traits, and compiled them into what they called "The Big Five": emotional balance, extroversion, consentiusness, agreableness and openness to new experiences.

The authors of this study also noted that agreeableness and emotional balance account for the biggest disparities. For example, business leaders in the UK had among the lowest scores on agreeableness, received average scores in emotional balance while getting high scores in extroversion. On the other hand managers and executives in Japan scored high in emotional balance and very low in extroversion.

But this is not the only criteria on the subject, for example, another author classified said differences into 8 scales: communicating, evaluating, leading, deciding, trusting, disagreeing and scheduling. These scales, for example 'evaluating', range from one end of the spectrum, direct negative feedback, to the other, indirect negative feedback. The main purpose behind this is to allow both parties to consider where do they fall in these scales and enable them to adapt accordingly.

In conclusion, while there may be many ways to categorize and analize these discrepancies in behaviour and communication style, it's worth noting that being aware of them and adapting around them is crucial to succeed at interacting with people from different cultures.
